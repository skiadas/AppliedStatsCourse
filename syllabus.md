## Course Description

Applied Statistics focuses on the statistical study of data, its collection, description and inference based on sample data. Some examples:

- suppose presidential election polls these days show the two candidates getting the same percentage of support. What does that really mean? That the candidates would get exactly that percentage, if we were to hold elections this moment? How was this percentage obtained, and how reliable is it? What range should we expect their true percentage to be in (in other words, what is our margin of error)?
- Suppose 10 people measured the length of the same room, and they all found somewhat different results. What does this tell us about the length of the room?
- Can we identify a literary work as belonging to a particular author based on how often common words appear in it, compared to the author's other works?
- How do we determine the speed of light? It is reasonable to believe that different attempts at measuring that speed would provide us with slightly different values, which one is "correct"?

In this course, we will develop the tools to be able to answer these kinds of questions. Simply put:

> In Statistics our goal is to understand the uncertainty and variability inherent in every experiment/phenomenon/measurement, and to attempt to control that variability.

Broadly speaking, the coarse is divided into three parts. We will start with Descriptive Statistics, which deals with the various ways of presenting data, their summaries and inter-relationships, and the problems one might encounter when doing that, both from using bad graphing techniques and from relying too much on numerical summaries. You will be able to understand the pitfalls when people and the media quote average numbers and percentages, and you will be able to put those numbers into a proper perspective. You will familiarize yourselves with the various types of graphs, their strengths and weaknesses, as well as common steps to make the information from the graphs more clearly presented.

The second, brief, part of the course deals with the design of experiments, and sampling methods. It is an introduction to the methods used to collect data, and the problems that arise. As an example, during the great depression a popular magazine made an extremely wrong prediction about who would win the presidential elections, which led to the downfall of that magazine. Their description was based on a massive survey that ended up getting answers from almost 2 million people, so it seems very surprising that they would get things wrong. We will investigate the mistakes that they made, and why having this enormous sample size didn't necessarily help them. We will also touch briefly on some of the fundamental principles employed in designing a study or experiment.

The final part of the course deals with Inferential Statistics. Inferential Statistics concerns itself with making predictions about a population based on information from a small sample. For instance, when CNN reports that Obama and McCain both have 47% support, based on a sample of 1000 people, what does that really tell us about the voting preference of all Americans? And what is it that makes us certain that those 1000 people that were polled are sufficient to make a prediction? Would we have been able to make a better prediction with more people, or does it not matter how many we have after a while? Can we provide some range of values that we can be pretty sure the candidate's actual percentage would be in? If a baseball player has a better on-base percentage than another player on a particular season, does this mean that they are truly better at getting to base? Or did they just happen to have a better season? At which point is it true skill and not just 'luck'?

In order to understand the mechanics behind Inferential Statistics, we will need to spend some time studying the basics of Probability Theory and the notion of a random variable. Probability Theory is the mathematical study of random phenomena and processes, and it will provide us a tool to deal with a wide range of situations, from sampling from a large population to simply a basketball player shooting from the free-throw line, or even the various tests for diseases and how reliable they are.

## Goals

The course has the following main objectives:

- You will learn how to critically think about, analyse and evaluate data, and how to formulate your conclusions.
- You will be using computer technology to analyse real data from various disciplines, often involving large data sets that would be very difficult to analyse in other ways.
- You will work in small groups to complete a term project, which will contain the formulation of a research question and methodology, as well as the collection and analysis of the resulting data. You will have the chance to present both an oral and a written report at the end of the semester. You will thus demostrate skills in developing a thesis statement, supporting that thesis with logical rationale and quantitative evidence, and presenting that thesis in a convincing fashion, orally and in writing.
- You will be introduced to probability theory, which provides the solid foundations on which all statistical inference procedures are based. This will provide you with an understanding of the nature of symbolic language, formal reasoning, and the process of solving problems by means of abstract modeling.

## Course Components

### Reading Notes and Practice Problems

On the website you will find a [schedule](http://skiadas.github.io/AppliedStatsCourse/site/schedule.html) with links to documents for each class day. In those documents you will find notes for the day's lesson, a reading assignment, and a list of practice problems. You should work on those practice problems, and ask any questions you have about them. You do not have to turn the problems in.

### Class Attendance

You are expected to attend every class meeting, including labs. You are only allowed to miss 3 classes without excuse. From that point on, every unexcused absence will result in a reduction of your final score by one percentage point, up to a total of 5 points. Excused absences should be arranged in advance, and backed by appropriate documentation. Emergencies will be dealt with on an individual basis. There are very few reasons that would qualify as an excuse for an absence.

### Homework Assignments

Around once or twice a week, I will be assigning homework. These will be collected, and counted on a completion scale of $0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1$, depending on how much effort you have put and how complete your work is. Questions on the quizzes and exams tend to be similar to the homework problems, so it is to your advantage to really *understand* the homework, and not merely "do it" or copy it just to get it turned in. Homework assignments are 5% of your final grade.

### Online quizzes

We will be using the [Moodle platform](http://moodle.hanover.edu) for online quizzes and homework assignments. You will typically have one quiz each week. Each quiz has a two hour time limit, and will have a deadline no more than a week after we cover that topic. You are allowed to take the quiz up to 3 times before that deadline, and you receive feedback after each attempt. Only the best of those 3 tries will count. You are expected to work on the quizzes on your own, and you are allowed to refer to the book and class notes while taking them. Your quiz score is 10% of your final grade.

### Exams

There will be two midterms, on Wednesday, October 7th and Monday, November 9th, and a final/3rd midterm during finals week. **You have to be here for the exams**. If you have conflicts with these days, let me know as soon as possible. Do not plan your vacation before you are aware of the finals schedule. In terms of your final grade, the exams you did better on will weigh more.

### Term Project

Throughout the semester, you will work in groups of three on a term project. The project consists of four phases:

- Getting a group together and formulating your research question and methodology. This should happen within the first 2-3 weeks.
- Collecting the data necessary for answering the question. This should take the next 1-2 weeks.
- Analysing the data. This should take the next 4-5 weeks.
- Writing a report and presenting your conclusions to the other students. This will happen during the last 2-3 weeks.

Here is a more specific schedule:

- In the first week you should find two more people to be your teammates. The teams should email me by the end of the **first week**. Any people not in an assigned team by Monday of the second week will be assigned a team by me. When forming your teams, you will need to also have, and email to me along with the team member names, at least **5 hours** during the week that you can all meet to work on the project, or if that is not possible, then exactly how you are planning to meet and work together on the project. By joining a team you are making a commitment to your team-mates, to work with them over the semester. I expect you to honor that commitment.
- All teams should email me their proposals in class by the end of 2nd week. These proposals should fit in at most 2 pages, plus a third page with the survey questions, prepared in Word or something similar, and contain the following:
    - A **project description**. What is the main focus of your project? What kind of relation/phenomenon are you trying to examine with this project? Be **original**, find something that interests you.
    - A list of the **variables** you will be measuring. You should have, at the very least, two categorical and two quantitative variables, and overall about 6 to 8 variables. These should be accompanied with a short list of what interactions you expect between these variables. These **expectations** can then be used as a starting point when analyzing the data.
    - A description of the methodology you are going to follow for collecting your data. Is it going to be a survey? How will it be administered? Are you going to collect data from the internet? How are you planning to assert the reliability of that data?

    I will give you a sample proposal by the end of the first week, so that you have a model to base yours on.

  - These proposals should be finalized by the end of the third week. In the next two weeks, your data should be collected and assembled in a datasheet. This sheet should be emailed to me no later than the end of the sixth week.
  - From this point on, you should gather together and analyse your data, discussing how it helps you answer the questions, and any pitfalls and problems you might have. We will spend some lab time on this part to get you started, but you will be expected to make considerable progress outside of the lab times. **It is very important that this part of the analysis be done with all 3 members working together**.
  - A **final paper report** will be due during the last week. You may send me draft reports before that, if you want to receive feedback on them, and I strongly encourage you to do that.
  - The last two days of classes will be devoted to in-class **presentations** of your project. This is an opportunity to talk about your work to members of the other teams, as well as hear about their projects. **Each** member of the team will have to talk for at least 5 minutes.

### Getting Help

- The learning center has set up study groups for the class. USE THEM!
- You should never hesitate to ask me questions. I will never think any less of anyone for asking a question. Stop by my office hours or just email me your question, which has the great benefit of forcing you to write it down in clear terms, which often helps you understand it better.
- You are allowed, and in fact encouraged, to work together and help each other regarding the notes and the practice problems. However, I strongly encourage you to try the problems out on your own first before talking to someone about them.
- You may discuss homework problems with others, but only after you have spent some time trying them on your own. And in any event the submitted work must be your own! So even though you may talk to others about the problem, when you sit down to write the answers you should be on your own.
- Your work on the online quizzes must be your own. You may ask me or the tutors for questions.

## Grading

Your final grade depends on class attendance, homework, project, quizzes, midterms and the final, as follows:

     Component   Percent
--------------  --------
    Attendance        5%
      Homework        5%
       Quizzes       10%
       Project       15%
 Worst Midterm       15%
Middle Midterm       20%
  Best Midterm       30%

This gives a number up to 100, which is then converted to a letter grade based roughly on the following correspondence:

 Letter grade     Percentage Range
--------------   -----------------
   A, A-                  90%-100%
   B+, B, B-               80%-90%
   C+, C, C-               70%-80%
   D+, D, D-               60%-70%
      F                     0%-60%
--------------   -----------------
