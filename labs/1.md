# Lab 1: Introduction to SPSS

This lab will introduce you to how to:

   - start up SPSS
   - import new data into SPSS
   - change the properties of the variables
   - produce basic frequency tables
   - produce basic graphs

## Starting up SPSS

- You will find SPSS under "All programs", in a folder titled "IBM SPSS Statistics".
There might be multiple versions there, you want the version 22, and the one that says nothing else after it; it should have the greek letter Sigma on its icon.
- It might offer you some pop-up windows at the start, just exit out of them until you see an Excel-like spreadsheet view.
