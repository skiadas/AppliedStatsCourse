# Applied Statistics HW 2

1. For each of the following histograms, describe the distribution, specifically focusing on the shape (modes, skewness) and the presence of outliers. Say a few words about the **reasons** for the presence of skewness and outliers, in the context of the particular data set under discussion. Describe a central/typical value, and how that value makes sense. Describe a range/spread, for the values, and how that makes sense.

3. In a challenging mathematical competition, all the students receive scores in the range from 0 to 20. The median score is reported to be 0. Explain what this would mean. What score do most students get?
