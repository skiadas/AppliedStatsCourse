# Applied Statistics HW 5

1. In a test, students receive a grade from 1 to 100. In a class consisting of about 500 students, their test scores follow an approximately normal distribution, with a mean of 76.5 and a standard deviation of 10.3.
    a. Students who scored 95 and above would get an A. Approximately how many students would that be?
    \vfill
    b. How many students approximately scored in the B range of 80 to 90?
    \vfill
    \newpage
    c. What was the first quartile score?
    \vfill
    d. The teacher will assign an F to those students that scored 60 or below. How many students approximately would that be?

2. Batting averages for baseball players are approximately distributed, and have an average of 0.278 with a standard deviation of 0.02.
    a. We could call someone an exceptional batter, if his batting average is in the top 1% of all batting averages (BA). What BA does such a batter need to have, at least?
    \vfill
    b. Provide a range of batting averages that would encompass 99.9% of all BAs.

    \newpage
    c. A certain batter scored a 0.267. What percentile is that value?
