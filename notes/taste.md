# A taste of statistics

Statistics is all about numbers *with a context*. Each number corresponds to some real life context, and it is important to never lose site of that.

In this section we get a taste of the richness of statistical information and visualization, by exploring a [rich interactive data set](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/) of information about the various countries. A [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJTBMjHYFR0) showcases the amazing possibilities there.

Some questions we will consider while exploring this data set.

1. How do the economies of various countries compare in 2015?
2. What effect did the second world war have on the European countries, and the United States?
3. How do we see the effect that the first world war and the spanish flu epidemic had on the world population?
4. What countries had a sudden drop in life expectancy in 1933, and what event triggered this drop?

Your first homework will ask you to explore this data further.
