## Notes

- There are two main measures of center, and another less used:

    Median
      ~ The "middle" value. Half the values are below it, half above.

        Denoted by $M$.

        The median is stable to the effects of outliers.

    Mean
      ~ Numerical average of all values.

        Denoted by $\bar x$.

        The mean has nice numerical properties, but it is affected by outliers.

    Trimmed-mean
      ~ A mean computed after a percent of data from each end is removed.

        Resembles the mean, but is not much affected by outliers.

- NOTE: The book, and other resources, talk about the **mode**, referring to the "most frequent value". We will not use that term for this purpose in this class, but you should be aware of it.
- One important consideration is how these measures behave to changes in the data. This is the notion of "resistance":

    Resistant
      ~ A measure is called *resistant*, if its value is not considerably affected by extreme changes to a few data values.

        In particular, outliers can be considered as values that were near others but their value somehow changed radically. So resistant measures are not affected much by outliers.

- Based on this description, the median is a resistant measure, but the mean is not. (THINK ABOUT IT!)
- Measures of center and skeweness:

    Symmetric
      ~ Mean and Median about the same

    Skewed right
      ~ The top half of the numbers pulled up, they take the mean with them.

        Mean bigger than Median

    Skewed left
      ~ The bottom half of the numbers pulled down, they take the mean with them.

        Mean smaller than Median
