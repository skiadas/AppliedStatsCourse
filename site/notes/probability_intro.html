<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>Probability is the mathematical study of “random phenomena”. In such a “random phenomenon” we make some key assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>While we may not know what outcome will occur each time, we do know what the possible outcomes are.</li>
<li>We also have a notion/assumption about the long-term relative frequency of outcomes over a long series of repetitions of the phenomenon.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a simple example, consider rolling a 6-sided die:</p>
<ul>
<li>We know that only the outcomes 1 through 6 are possible.</li>
<li>If the die is “fair”, then if we roll the die many many times we expect about 1/6th of them to come up 1, 1/6th to come up 2 and so on.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>sample space</strong> for a random phenomenon, denoted by S, is the set of possible outcomes.</p>
<p>The <strong>probability of an outcome</strong> is the long-term relative frequency of that outcome.</p>
<p>The sum of all the probabilities for all outcomes must equal 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us look at some standard “random phenomena/experiments”. We will typically refer to them as “probability models”, they are idealized theoretical representations of an experiment (i.e. thinking of flipping a coin and what would happen, rather than actually flipping a physical coin and recording the results).</p>
<dl>
<dt>Coin Flip</dt>
<dd>Flipping a fair coin. Sample space: <span class="math">\(\{H, T\}\)</span>. Probability of <span class="math">\(1/2\)</span> for each.
</dd>
<dt>Unfair Coin Flip</dt>
<dd>Flipping an unfair coin. <span class="math">\(P(H) = p\)</span>, <span class="math">\(P(T) = 1-p\)</span>.
</dd>
<dt>Five-sided die</dt>
<dd>Rolling a “five-sided” die. From a mathematical point of view there is no problem with that. Sample space: <span class="math">\(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\)</span>. Probability of <span class="math">\(1/5\)</span>th for each.
</dd>
<dt>Unfair die</dt>
<dd>Imagine a five-sided die where “1” is 3 times as likely as any of the others. Find their probabilities.
</dd>
<dt>Smoking and Gender</dt>
<dd>Suppose we have 100 students. 25 of them smoke, and of those 12 are women. The remaining 75 students do not smoke, and of those 60 are women. Write down the possible outcomes with their probabilities.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A key concept in probability theory is that of an event:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An <strong>event</strong> is a collection of zero or more outcomes.</p>
<p>The probability of an event, <span class="math">\(P(E)\)</span>, is the sum of the probabilities of its outcomes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, here are some events for the 5-sided die model:</p>
<ul>
<li>A = “all even outcomes”. So <span class="math">\(A = \{2, 4\}\)</span>. <span class="math">\(P(A) = 2/5\)</span>.</li>
<li>B = “At least a 4”. So <span class="math">\(B = \{4, 5\}\)</span>. <span class="math">\(P(B) = 2/5\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>What events can you think of in the example model with smoking and gender? What are their probabilities?</p>
<h3 id="event-operations">Event Operations</h3>
<p>There are some standard ways to combine events:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Complement</dt>
<dd>The complement of an event <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, denoted <span class="math">\(A&#39;\)</span>, is the event consisting of all outcomes that are not in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>.
</dd>
<dt>Union</dt>
<dd>The union of two events <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, denoted <span class="math">\(A\cup B\)</span> or “<span class="math">\(A\textrm{ or }B\)</span>”, is all outcomes that are in at least one of the two sets. It informally says: “I want at least one of these two events to occur.”
</dd>
<dt>Intersection</dt>
<dd>The intersection of two events <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, denoted by <span class="math">\(A\cap B\)</span> or “<span class="math">\(A\textrm{ and }B\)</span>”, is all outcomes that belong to both sets. It informally says: “I want both events to occur <em>at the same time</em>.”
</dd>
</dl>
<p>For instance in the 5-side die example:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[A\textrm{ or }B = \{2, 4, 5\}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[A\textrm{ and }B = \{4\}\]</span></p>
<p>Key formula that relates the various probabilities:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\[P(A\textrm{ or }B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\textrm{ and }B)\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="conditional-probability">Conditional Probability</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The probability of an event <em>given another event</em> is called <strong>conditional probability</strong>. It is one of the hardest concepts to master.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(P(A|B)\)</span> is the probability of A occuring, given that B does occur.</p>
<p>Think of it as “restricting the sample space”: Only outcomes in <span class="math">\(B\)</span> matter; how many of those are also in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>?</p>
<p><span class="math">\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\textrm{ and }B)}{P(B)}\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example: In the case of the 5-sided die, let us compute <span class="math">\(P(A|B)\)</span>.</p>
<p>In words this says: Given the number is at least 4, what are the chances the number is even?</p>
<p>It will be: <span class="math">\(\frac{P(4)}{P(4\textrm{ or }5)} = \frac{1/5}{2/5} = 1/2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Notice the difference between <span class="math">\(P(A)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(P(A|B)\)</span>!!!</p>
