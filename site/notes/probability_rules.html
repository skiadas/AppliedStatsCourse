<p>Let us summarize the key probability rules we’ve encountered so far:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\[P(A&#39;) = 1 - P(A)\]</span> <span class="math">\[P(A\textrm{ or }B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\textrm{ and }B)\]</span> <span class="math">\[P(A\textrm{ or }B) = P(A) + P(B)\textrm{ if }A,B\textrm{ are disjoint}\]</span> <span class="math">\[P(A\textrm{ and }B) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B)\]</span> <span class="math">\[P(A\textrm{ and }B) = P(A)P(B)\textrm{ if }A,B\textrm{ are independent}\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are called the <strong>addition rule</strong> and the <strong>multiplication rule</strong> respectively.</p>
<p>We will see the rules in action in the following example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peter has two roads he can choose when he drives to work each day. He rolls a fair 5-sided die to decide, and if the outcome is an odd number then he takes road A, if it is even he takes road B. In road A there is a 70% chance of running into traffic, in road B there is a 40% chance.</p>
<p>Overall what is Peter’s chance of running into traffic?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us translate the information they have given us into events: There are effectively 4 “outcomes”:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Peter takes road A and finds traffic</li>
<li>Peter takes road A and doesn’t find traffic</li>
<li>Peter takes road B and finds traffic</li>
<li>Peter takes road B and doesn’t find traffic</li>
</ol>
<p>We are essentially interested in the event that is the combination of 1 and 3. What we are given is some partial information.</p>
<p>We will denote by A and B the two events for which road Peter can choose, and C the event that he runs into traffic. Then using the addition rule we can write:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[P(C) = P(A\textrm{ and }C) + P(B\textrm{ and }C)\]</span></p>
<p>So if we can find those two probabilities, we can also find the probability of C, which is what we were after. For that, we will use the multiplication rule:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[P(A\textrm{ and }C) = P(A)P(C|A)\]</span></p>
<p>Let us read the right-hand-side out: We multiply the probability that Peter takes road A (60%) with the probability that he runs into traffic given that he is taking road A (70%). This gives us the probability that he takes road A and runs into traffic (42%).</p>
<p>Similarly:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[P(B\textrm{ and }C) = P(B)P(C|B) = 0.4\times 0.4 = 0.16 = 16\%\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore the total probability that Peter will run into traffic is <span class="math">\(P(C) = 0.42 + 0.16 = 0.58\)</span>, or 58%.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Continuing on the same problem, suppose Peter does run into traffic. What are the chances, that he took road A?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To answer this question, we need to compute <span class="math">\(P(A|C)\)</span>. Let us use the formula:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[P(A|C) = \frac{P(A\textrm{ and }C)}{P(C)} = \frac{0.42}{0.58} = 0.7241\]</span></p>
<p>So there is a <span class="math">\(72.4\)</span>% chance that Peter took road A.</p>
<p>Let us think about this logically for a second: Given that we know that Peter ended up in traffic, his chance of having taken road A went up from 60% to 72%. This makes sense, because Peter would have been more likely to run into traffic via road A than via road B. So the fact that he ended up in traffic makes road A somewhat more likely.</p>
<p>The book has a number of other examples, study them!</p>
