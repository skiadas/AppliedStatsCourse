<p>This midterm is all about probability concepts.</p>
<p>This is meant to be a representative sampling of the key concepts you will need to know, and it is not meant to be exhaustive. You should make sure that you are comfortable with Quizzes 6-9 and Homework Assignments 9-14.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What are the key characteristics of a <em>random phenomenon</em>?</li>
<li>What can we say about the probabilities of outcomes in a random phenomenon / probability model? Can they be any numbers? There are some restrictions to them (both on what numbers they can be, and on what their sum must be).</li>
<li>What is an <em>event</em> and how do we define its probability?</li>
<li>What is the <em>complement</em> of an event? What is a formula for its probability?</li>
<li>What is the <em>union</em> of two events, what is the <em>intersection</em> of two events? What rule must their probabilities obey?</li>
<li>What is the definition of <em>conditional probability</em>? Include a formula and also a more meaningful verbal definition.</li>
<li>What does the <em>multiplicative rule</em> say?</li>
<li>When do we say that two events are <em>independent</em> of each other? Provide some examples both of events that are independent of each other and events that are not independent of each other.</li>
<li>In general when do we tend to multiply probabilities? When do we tend to add them?</li>
<li>When can I say that <span class="math">\(P(A\cap B) = P(A)P(B)\)</span>?</li>
<li>When can I say that <span class="math">\(P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\)</span>?</li>
<li>What are the different parts in a tree diagram / decision tree? What probabilities do we associate with each part?</li>
<li>What differentiates <em>random variables</em> from other random phenomena? Give examples of random variables</li>
<li>What conditions must we meet in order to be in the <em>binomial setting</em>?</li>
<li>What is the formula for the <em>binomial distribution</em>?</li>
<li>How do we compute the mean and the standard deviation of a random variable?</li>
<li>How do we compute the mean and standard deviation of the binomial distribution?</li>
<li>What can we say about the mean and standard deviation of a linear transformation of a variable?</li>
<li>What can we say about the mean and standard deviation of a sum of two variables?</li>
