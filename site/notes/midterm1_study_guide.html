<p>This is meant to be a representative sampling of the key concepts you will need to know, and it is not meant to be exhaustive. You should make sure that you are comfortable with Quizzes 1-3 and Homework Assignments 1-6, as well as the recommended problems from the book.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In what way does the data we use in statistics differ from just a bunch of numbers?</li>
<li>What are the main types of variables? What distinguishes them?</li>
<li>What types of graphs do we have available? When do we use which graph? What are advantages/disadvantages of each type of graph compared to other graphs for the same variable?</li>
<li>What terms do we use to describe the distribution of a scalar variable? Demonstrate with examples.</li>
<li>What are the various measures of center? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?</li>
<li>The IQR and the standard deviation both measure spread, but they do so in totally different ways. Explain in what way they attempt to measure “spread”.</li>
<li>What happens to the shape, center and spread of a distribution of a variable when it undergoes a linear transformation?</li>
<li>How does the “suspected outlier test” work?</li>
<li>How is the (modified) boxplot drawn?</li>
<li>Suppose a distribution is skewed to the right. How will that show in the boxplot?</li>
<li>What does it mean to say that a measure is <em>resistant</em>?</li>
<li>In terms of the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-values, what are the first and third quartile for the normal distribution?</li>
<li>What percent of values in a normal distribution would be classified as outliers?</li>
<li>How do we find where the middle 40% of data lies in a normal distribution?</li>
<li>How do we go back and forth between <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in a normal distribution?</li>
<li>What is the IQR of the standard normal distribution?</li>
<li>What units are the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-values measured in?</li>
<li>Describe how stratified sampling and cluster sampling work, and how they differ from simple random sampling. In what situations might we choose to use stratified sampling? What about cluster sampling?</li>
<li>What is the difference between an observational study and an experiment?</li>
