<ul>
<li>The goal of measures of spead is to assess the “variation” in the data in some way.</li>
<li>Different measures achieve this in different ways.</li>
<li><p>The two main measures of spread are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Std. Dev.</dt>
<dd><p>Standard Deviation. Measures distance of data from the mean.</p>
<p>Often denoted by <span class="math">\(s\)</span>.</p>
<p>Not resistant.</p>
</dd>
<dt>IQR</dt>
<dd><p>Interquartile range. Measures range occupied by the middle 50% of the data.</p>
<p>Resistant.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><p>Let us review how the standard deviation is computed. Its formula is a bit complicated, and it looks something like this:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum (x-\bar{x})^2}\]</span></p>
Basically:
<ul>
<li>Compute the mean of all the values.</li>
<li>Subtract the mean from each value (the result of this step is the “<strong>deviations</strong>”).</li>
<li>Square all the deviations.
<ul>
<li>Ensures values are positive before computing average.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Average these squared deviations: Add them all up, then divide by <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span>. The result at this stage is called the <strong>variance</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Why <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span>: Technical reason, and won’t really matter for large <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</li>
<li>One way to think about it: The deviations always add up to <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, so once you know <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> of them the last one is determined.</li>
<li>In this context, <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> is called the “degrees of freedom”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Take a square root at the end.
<ul>
<li>Fixes the units of measurement.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Outliers have a considerable effect on this formula.
<ul>
<li>They have a very large deviation, and because they pull the mean towards themselves they cause larger deviations in the other values as well.</li>
<li>Because we square them before adding, those large deviations will dominate the equation even more.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What to use depends on the distribution:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Symmetric</dt>
<dd>Mean for center, Standard Deviation for spread
</dd>
<dt>Skewed/Outliers</dt>
<dd>Median for center, IQR for spread
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li>Chebyshev’s Rule:
<ul>
<li>At least 75% of the data is within 2 standard deviations from the mean</li>
<li>At least 89% of the data is within 3 standard deviations from the mean</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For Bell Shaped data (Empirical Rule):
<ul>
<li>Approximately 68% of the data is within one standard deviation of the mean.</li>
<li>Approximately 95% of the data is within two standard deviations of the mean.</li>
<li>More than 99% of the data is within three standard deviations of the mean.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
