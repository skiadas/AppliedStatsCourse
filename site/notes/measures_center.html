<li><p>There are two main measures of center, and another less used:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Median</dt>
<dd><p>The “middle” value. Half the values are below it, half above.</p>
<p>Denoted by <span class="math">\(M\)</span>.</p>
<p>The median is stable to the effects of outliers.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Mean</dt>
<dd><p>Numerical average of all values.</p>
<p>Denoted by <span class="math">\(\bar x\)</span>.</p>
<p>The mean has nice numerical properties, but it is affected by outliers.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Trimmed-mean</dt>
<dd><p>A mean computed after a percent of data from each end is removed.</p>
<p>Resembles the mean, but is not much affected by outliers.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li>NOTE: The book, and other resources, talk about the <strong>mode</strong>, referring to the “most frequent value”. We will not use that term for this purpose in this class, but you should be aware of it.</li>
<li><p>One important consideration is how these measures behave to changes in the data. This is the notion of “resistance”:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Resistant</dt>
<dd><p>A measure is called <em>resistant</em>, if its value is not considerably affected by extreme changes to a few data values.</p>
<p>In particular, outliers can be considered as values that were near others but their value somehow changed radically. So resistant measures are not affected much by outliers.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><p>Based on this description, the median is a resistant measure, but the mean is not. (THINK ABOUT IT!)</p></li>
