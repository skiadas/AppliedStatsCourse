<p>This is meant to be a representative sampling of the key concepts you will need to know, and it is not meant to be exhaustive. You should make sure that you are comfortable with Quizzes 10-11 and Homework Assignments 15-17.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What are the mean and standard deviation of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat p\)</span> in a binomial setting?</li>
<li>What condition must <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> satisfy in order for us to be able to use the normal distribution for the computations in a binomial setting?</li>
<li>What conditions must hold in order for us to be in the IID setting?</li>
<li>What do <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> represent in the IID setting?</li>
<li>What are the formulas for the mean and standard deviation of <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> in the IID setting?</li>
<li>What does the Central Limit Theorem say?</li>
<li>What do we refer to when we talk about the <em>sampling distribution</em> of <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span>?</li>
<li>What quantities do we refer to as <em>parameters</em>, and what quantities do we refer to as <em>statistics</em>?</li>
<li>What is the general goal of a <em>confidence interval</em>?</li>
<li>State precisely what the confidence interval for the population mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> says, describing all the terms needed along the way.</li>
<li>What are the options we have when we want to reduce the <em>margin of error</em>? What are the tradeoffs?</li>
<li>How do we compute the sample size needed to achieve a specific margin of error?</li>
<li>What is the general idea behind a hypothesis test?</li>
<li>What are the two kinds of conclusions we can get from a hypothesis test?</li>
<li>What errors do we refer to as Type I errors? What about Type II errors?</li>
<li>What three parts of our work in a hypothesis test or confidence interval are affected by the sample size and a change in the sample size?</li>
