<h3 id="random-variables-1">Random Variables</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>random variable</strong> <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the numeric outcome of a random phenomenon. For instance, when we roll a die and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the outcome, the possible values are <span class="math inline">\(1, 2, \ldots, 6\)</span>.</p>
<p>When we have a random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, we write <span class="math inline">\(P(X=k)\)</span> for the probability that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> takes the value <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. We will often also look at <span class="math inline">\(P(X&gt;k)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(X\geq k)\)</span>, and similarly for “less than”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Random variables are separated in <strong>discrete</strong> and <strong>continuous</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Discrete</dt>
<dd>Discrete random variables are those that take a finite set of possible values (for instance the result of a die roll, counting the number of heads in 5 coin flips and so on).
</dd>
<dt>Continuous</dt>
<dd>Continuous random variables are those that take values in a whole range. A variable that follows the normal distribution is a good example of that.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>We will mostly study discrete distributions, with the exception of the normal distribution.</p>
<h3 id="random-variables-and-sampling">Random Variables and Sampling</h3>
<p>We can think of any “fixed” variable with numerical values as a random variable. For instance imagine we have a group of 20 people, 4 of them with no siblings, 5 with 1 sibling, 10 of them with 2 siblings and 1 with 3 siblings.</p>
<p>The number of siblings in this case is one of the standard, fixed, variables we studied at the beginning of the class. In SPSS it would correspond to a column with 20 rows on it, 4 of which are 0, 5 of them are 1 and so on.</p>
<p>We can also think of a corresponding random variable: “Pick one person at random, and look at the number of siblings”. The possible outcomes are <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, and their probabilities are equal to the <em>relative frequencies</em> of those outcomes. For instance <span class="math inline">\(P(1) = 5 / 20 = 1 / 4\)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(X=k)\longleftrightarrow\textrm{relative frequency of }k\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="probability-distribution-function">Probability Distribution Function</h3>
<p>The <em>Probability Distribution Function</em> (often abreviated as PDF or pdf) is the function that for a given <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> tells us what <span class="math inline">\(P(X=k)\)</span> is. For discrete distributions, we can express it as a table. Let us look at an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We roll a fair 6-sided die. If it is 3 or less, we don’t win anything. If it is 4 or more we win <span class="math inline">\(\$1\)</span> and roll the die a second time. If that second time is a <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> then we win one more dollar.</p>
<p>X is the number of dollars we end up winning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make a tree/decision diagram showing how the play might go, and what values of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> you get on each resulting path. You should end up with the following table:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="right">X</td>
<td align="right">0</td>
<td align="right">1</td>
<td align="right">2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="right">P(X)</td>
<td align="right"><span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span></td>
<td align="right"><span class="math inline">\(1/3\)</span></td>
<td align="right"><span class="math inline">\(1/6\)</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Let us consider one more example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice and Bob play a game involving rolling a die. If the die is 4 or more, Bob wins <span class="math inline">\(\$1\)</span>, if it is 5 or more then Alice wins <span class="math inline">\(\$2\)</span>.</p>
<p>X denotes the difference between Bob’s winnings and Alice’s winnings.</p>
<p>There are two versions of the problem: One where Alice and Bob use the same, single, die roll, and one where they use two different die rolls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Construct tree diagrams and corresponding probability tables for both cases.</p>
<p>And one more example for practice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You play a game that involves a coin that has a <span class="math inline">\(70\%\)</span> chance of coming up heads. You start by paying <span class="math inline">\(\$2\)</span> for the opportunity to play. You then get to flip the coin. Each time it lands heads you win a dollar, up to a total of 3 coin flips. BUT the first time you get tails the game stops.</p>
<p>X is the total net gain (accounting for the 2 dollars you had to pay at the beginning)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Create a tree diagram and a probability table for this problem.</p>
