<li><p>For each of the following histograms, describe the distribution, specifically focusing on the shape (modes, skewness) and the presence of outliers. Say a few words about the reasons for the presence of skewness and outliers, in the context of the particular data set under discussion. Describe a central/typical value, and how that value makes sense. Describe a range/spread, for the values, and how that makes sense.</p>
