<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>GPA scores at a particular college have a mean of 2.9 and standard deviation 0.4, and they are approximately normally distributed.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>How many students have scored between 2.5 and 3.0? </li>
<li>The college is worried about any student that has a GPA of less than 2. What percent of the students have such a low GPA? </li>
<li>One could consider the middle 80% of the students as representative of the college. What range of GPA scores would that middle 80% fall in? </li>
<li>Obviously 4.0 is an upper bound for the GPA, but in terms of the normal distri- bution higher scores are in theory allowed. What percent of the students would be scoring 4.0 or more, according to the normal distribution? </li>
<li>The college wants to award scholarships to the top 15% of the students. What would the GPA cutoff for the scholarships be? </li>
<li>Where would the first and third quartile of the GPA distribution be? What is the inter-quartile range of the grade distribution? </li>
<li>Above what GPA score and below what GPA score would the outlier test classify students as outliers? What percent of the students fall in that range? </li>
<li>The college gives cum laude to those students graduating with a gpa between 3.65 and 3.8. What percent of the students would fall in that range? </li>
<li>The college is thinking of moving to a percent system instead, where the students who are between the 85th and 90th percentile are those that would get cum laude. What gpa range does that correspond to? </li>
