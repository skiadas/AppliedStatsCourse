<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We will be picking a student at random from the whole Hanover population. We will be looking at their gender, and whether they smoke or not. Imagine the following numbers: 65% chance of the students are female, so there is a 65% chance that a randomly selected student will be female. 25% of our students are females that smoke, so there is a 25% chance that a randomly selected student is female AND smokes. 20% of our students are males that smoke, so there is a 20% chance that a randomly selected student will be male and smoke.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>We can model this situation with a probability model with 4 outcomes, to account for the various combinations of smoking and gender. What are those outcomes? </li>
<li>What are the chances, that a randomly selected student is female AND does not smoke? </li>
<li>What are the chances, that a randomly selected student is male? </li>
<li>What are the chances, that a randomly selected student is male and does not smoke? </li>
<li>What are the chances, that a randomly selected student does not smoke? </li>
<li>What are the chances, that a randomly selected student is either male or does not smoke, or possibly both? </li>
<li>Suppose we select 10 students at random. What are the chances, that they will all turn out to be females? </li>
</ol></li>
<li>In a game of chance, you have a 25% chance of winning. What are the chances, that you will lose 3 times in a row? What are the chances that you will win at least one of the 3 rounds? </li>
<li>John gets to shoot 5 shots from the free throw line. We know from past experience, that for any particular shot, he has an 80% chance of getting it in. What are his chances of getting all 5 shots in? </li>
<li>We roll a 6-sided die that is biased: The sides 1, 2, 3 are all twice as likely as the sides 4, 5, 6. What are the various possible outcomes and their probabilities? </li>
<li>We flip twice a coin which has a 90% chance of coming heads. We then count the number of heads. What are the possible outcomes, and how likely is each outcome? </li>
