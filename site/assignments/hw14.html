<li>We have a 4-sided die where the side 1 is three times as likely as all the others.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Denote by X the outcome of rolling the die once. What is the probability distribu- tion for X? </li>
<li>What are the mean and standard deviation? </li>
<li>Suppose we now roll the die twice. Denote by <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> the outcome of the first roll, by <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> the outcome of the second roll, and by <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> the sum of the two outcomes. Describe how Y relates to the other two, and use this information to construct the probability table for Y. </li>
<li>Compute the mean and standard deviation of Y both from the table directly, and using the formula on how Y relates to <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> and the mean and stand deviation values for those. </li>

<li>Peter has bought shares in two stocks. Let’s denote by X the profit that one share of stock A makes for him after a week, and by Y the profit that one share of stock B makes for him after the same week. We don’t of course know precisely what X,Y would be, but let’s imagine that X has a mean of $10 with a standard deviation of $3, while Y has a mean of $20 with a standard deviation of $5, and also that they are independent of each other. He has 15 shares of stock A and 25 shares of stock B. The overall profit he makes would then be <span class="math inline">\(Z = 15X + 25Y\)</span>. What are the mean and standard deviation for his overall profit? </li>
<li>Alice and Bob play the following game: They roll a 6-sided die ONCE. Alice earns a dollar as long as the die is 4 or more. Bob earns two dollars as long as the die is a 1 or a 6 (on that same roll). So it is possible that they both benefit from the roll, or only one of them, or neither. Let’s denote by X the difference in dollars earned between Alice and Bob, namely how much Alice made minus how much Bob made.
