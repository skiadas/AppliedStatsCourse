<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In a lottery game, there are 60 people playing. Each person picks a number from 1 to 100 (and multiple people could pick the same number). Then a machine produces a number between 1 and 100 at random, and whoever had picked that same number wins. Denote by X the number of winners.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Can X be described with a binomial distribution? i.e. does it correspond to the number of successes in a binomial setting? Explain exactly what the trials are, what success means etc. </li>
<li>What are the chances, that we will have at least 2 winners? </li>
<li>Are the events “We will have at least 2 winners” and “We will have at least 1 winner” independent of each other? </li>
</ol></li>
<li>John has a 4-sided die where the number 1 is twice as likely as the other three numbers. He proceeds to roll the die twice and add the outcomes. Denote by X the resulting sum, which is a random variable. Determine its probability distribution. </li>
<li>We roll a 4-sided die two times. Each time it comes a 4, you win $3, each time it comes 1 through 3 you lose a $1. We denote by X the amount of money you gain from this game.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>What are the possible values for X and their probabilities (i.e. the probability distribution of X)? </li>
<li>What are your chances of losing in this game? </li>
</ol></li>
<li>Admissions is working through their data to try to estimate enrollment for the coming year. They separate the prospective students into three categories. Category A consists of students who for a number of reasons are very likely to come to Hanover. Only 5% of the prospective students fall into this category, however there is a 95% chance that a student in category A will decide to come here next year. Category B consists of students who have expressed an interest to some extent, in the form of deposits or campus visits. This category comprises 25% of the prospective students. A student in category B has a 65% chance of coming to Hanover. Finally, the remaining students are placed in category C. There is only a 32% chance that a student from category C will come to Hanover.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>What percent of the prospective students would decide to come to Hanover? </li>
<li>What percent of the students in the incoming class will be from category A? How does that number compare to the percent of prospective students that are in cate- gory A? How does that make sense? </li>
<li>Admissions decides to consolidate categories A and B. What percent of the students from this new category will come to Hanover? What percent of the incoming students will be from this new category?</li>
