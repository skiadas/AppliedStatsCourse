<h1 id="project-preparation">Project Preparation</h1>
<p>This is the first step in your project. It consists of two parts.</p>
<h3 id="project-proposal">Project Proposal</h3>
<p>You will need to prepare a 1-page proposal for your project, after looking at the project description. The proposal should consist of the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A project title.</li>
<li>List of the group members.</li>
<li>A brief paragraph describing the project.</li>
<li>A brief list of questions you hope to answer in your investigations.</li>
<li>A list of the variables in the dataset, with a description of each variable, including the variable’s type (scalar, ordinal, nominal). In the case where the dataset has a lot more variables than you are planning to use, only include those variables that are pertinent to your project.</li>
</ol>
<p>The proposal should fit in a single page. Aim for brevity and staying on point.</p>
<h3 id="dataset-preparation">Dataset Preparation</h3>
<p>You should begin work on the dataset for your project.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Download the corresponding file.</li>
<li>Use the “Read Text Data” process to get the file into SPSS.</li>
<li>Use “Define Variable Properties” to set up the properties for the various variables in the dataset. In particular set the measurement type, set up a label for the variable, and set up value labels for the values of categorical variables if they are coded in a particular way. Read the project description for details on these codes.</li>
<li>Identify variables that should be ordered, but where the natural alphabetical order is incorrect. We will need to modify those variables in the future.</li>
<li>Save the SPSS data file.</li>
<li>You can stop here for now, or you can start creating graphs of the various individual variables involved, to start making sense of the data. We will be doing more of that later.</li>
</ol>
