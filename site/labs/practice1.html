<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Place your answers in a Word document.</li>
<li>Make sure to include graphs where needed. Adjust them so they are readable. Clean them up where needed.</li>
<li>Where tables are called for, don’t just use the tables from SPSS. Make nice-looking tables using Word’s abilities and only using the values from SPSS that you need to include.</li>
<li>You are allowed to work with others.</li>
<li>This will count as a homework.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Data containing information about the various counties can be downloaded at: https://skiadas.github.io/AppliedStatsCourse/site/datasets/countyComplete.txt You can also find them by navigating to the Datasets folder in the course website. Use the Read-Text-Data mechanism to import the data into SPSS. Each row in the data corresponds to a county.
<ul>
<li>How many counties do we have?</li>
<li>Which counties are the top 3 by population (2010)? Does it make sense that those counties have so much population?</li>
<li>Which counties are the bottom 3 by population?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Which three states have the most number of counties? Which three have the least number of counties? Describe how you found your answer.</li>
<li>Draw a suitable histogram of the distribution of population by county. You will need to possibly zoom in a region and leave out some outliers, to offer a better view. Describe the overall distribution.</li>
<li>Compute the median population for each state. List the top three and bottom three states.</li>
<li>Draw a suitable histogram of the percent of females in each county (the variable is called <code>female</code>). Describe the distribution.</li>
<li>Describe (including suitable graph and/or equations) the relationship between the population in 2010 and the population in 2000. Is there a general pattern? Does it make sense?</li>
<li>Compute (by creating a new variable) the <strong>relative</strong> population change on each county from 2000 to 2010: This should be the change (difference) in population divided by the 2000 population.
<ul>
<li>Draw a suitable histogram and describe the resulting pattern and reasons for it. Also compare to the overall US growth rate from 2000 to 2010 of 9.7%.</li>
<li>Locate some of the outliers (on both ends) and discuss their particular circumstances, where possible, and the reasons for these extreme changes from 2000 to 2010.</li>
<li>Which two states in Indiana had the highest relative population change? Make sure to identify them geographically.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Draw a suitable graph and describe the relationship between a county’s poverty rate and the percent of people in the county with high school degrees. Include a regression line if suitable.</li>
<li>Describe the distribution of the area of different counties. You may need to restrict the histogram to see the main pattern.
<ul>
<li>Describe the overall pattern, including a discussion of what the typical values for the area of a county are.</li>
<li>Describe deviations from that pattern, and their reasons.</li>
<li>Which states have a high median county area?</li>
</ul></li>
